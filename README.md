### Codebook3

Codebook 3 (now known as **Forge**) is a much improved version of Codebook 2, which was an admittedly primitive and messy RPN calculator scripting language
I implemented in Rust. Codebook 3, which from here will be referred to as Forge, is an interpreted stack-based language inspired by [Tsoding's Porth language.](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth)
